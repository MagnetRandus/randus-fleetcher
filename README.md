## Summary

This is the base system used to to deploy elements needed by SharePoint/SPFx solutions.  This solution (though in its beginning stages) provides a structured way to deploy elements and/or components needed by any SharePoint solution that needs to be built.

## How is this useful

1. This solution is useful when components needs to be deployed and/or retracted while developing and makes life much simpler for developing a solution.  There is no need to manually delete components after test data was written to it.
2. This solution helps a developer to keep track of components to be deployed and retracted or to add/remove test data.
3. This solution helps keep track of component inheritence on Content Types and Site Columns.  

## Future functionality

1. Keep track of managed metadata deployments in a solution.
2. Create custom deployment functionality on a per solution basis.
